# Modsecurity / NGINX Docker Image
This container is a 100% source build of NGINX and Modsecurity. The intent of this image is to be used as a WAF with complex configurations which are not possible with cloud provider provided WAF services. Modsecurity's rules can be configured in very advanced ways to do deep inspection on content and request/response bodies.

I periodically build images for personal use. The images are on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/robgil/modsecurity-nginx).
